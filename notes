    Do you enjoy sitting in traffic for hours? What about being late
    because it took you so long to find a car park? Or spending 1000s of
    dollars on registration, insurance, servicing, fuel and numerous other
    car related expenses?
</p>
<p className="mb-5">
    Many of us would love to never have to sit in traffic or battle for a
    car park again. We&apos;d also be very happy with an extra 20% in our
    bank account each year. But when we contemplate life without a car, it
    seems unrealistic and scary.
</p>
<p className="mb-5">
    Well we&apos;re here to tell you it&apos;s not and that it&apos;s
    actually MUCH easier than you probably think.
</p>
<p className="mb-5">
    Do you own a car? Maybe there&apos;s even 2 or more sitting in your
    driveway?
</p>
<p className="mb-5">
    It&apos;s not your fault! We&apos;re conditioned to see cars as a
    normal and necessary part of our everyday lives. The goal of Car Free
    Club is to show you that it&apos;s actually much easier than you think
    to live without owning a car, and if you&apos;re interested, help you
    along your journey.

    I used to be just like you... I loved my cars, it was my pride and
    joy. I drove EVERYWHERE - regardless of how near or far - never really
    considering how much money it was costing me, the impact it was having
    on my health or the pollution I was producing.
</p>
<p className="mb-5">
    Then something clicked. A friend challenged my to live car free for a
    month. At the beginning I was terrified of giving up my car and the
    freedom and convenience it provided me. But after a couple of weeks of
    public transport, riding my bike and walking places I realised owning
    a car wasn&apos;t freedom, it was actually having a negative impact on
    my wallet and happiness in general.
</p>
<p className="mb-5">
    So here&apos;s my challenge to you... Give it a try!
</p>
<p className="mb-5">
    I&apos;m not suggesting you wake up tomorrow and sell your car, but
    there&apos;s so many ways you can get started quickly and easily.
